# PaceSpace
PaceSpace is an educational platform that allows Students and Teachers to interact in a virtual classroom. Teachers can assign Missions that students must complete before the deadline. To incentivize students to better pace themselves instead of cramming the night before a project is due, extra credit is given to students who submit early. This application hopes to build better habits and work ethic for both students and teachers.

In this application, users can sign up either as Students or Teachers.

Teachers can:
* Create and view classes
* Enroll students into classes
* Assign projects for a class
* Grade project submissions

Students can:
* View their classes
* Upload project submissions

PaceSpace is Team HackerNovice's entry for the 2020 Ghostery Virtual Hackathon.
