# PaceSpace
PaceSpace is an educational platform that allows Students and Teachers to interact in a virtual classroom. Teacher can assign Projects split up into one or more parts called Missions. This will allow students to pace themselves instead of cramming an entire assignment the night before it is due. This application hopes to build better habits and work ethic for both students and teachers.

PaceSpace is Team HackerNovice's entry for the 2020 Ghostery Virtual Hackathon.
